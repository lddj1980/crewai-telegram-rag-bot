The CrewAI Telegram RAG Bot demonstrates how retrieval-augmented generation can enhance a chat experience. It combines CrewAI's agent orchestration with the OpenAI language model and a FAISS vector store to produce answers grounded in an existing text. This repository shows a minimal yet functional approach to building such an interactive assistant.

This document is the starting point for the bot's knowledge base. When you run the ingestion script, these paragraphs are indexed so the bot can reference them whenever someone asks a question. Feel free to expand the content here or adapt the code to point at your own data sources.
